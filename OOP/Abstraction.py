# Abstraction in Python
#
# Abstraction is used to hide the internal
# functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with
# the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden.
# User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."
#
# In simple words, we all use the smartphone and very much familiar with its functions such as camera,
# voice-recorder, call-dialing, etc., but we don't know how these operations are happening in the background. Let's
# take another example - When we use the TV remote to increase the volume. We don't know how pressing a key increases
# the volume of the TV. We only know to press the "+" button to increase the volume.
